Counting App

This app was a fun project that I wanted to develop using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
The app can be used to count the number of people in different situations.
When you hit the button "Increment" it counts the number of people increasing by one every time the button is pressed.
The button "Save" is to store the number of people prebiously counted using the "Increment" button and bring the number down to zero again every time it is used.
The interface is simple and the app can easily be used by anyone who wnats to count poeple anywhere.
People Counter+ is an essential application that operates as a tally counter when people enter venues such as discos, exhibitions, shops, theatres, etc. [3] With these apps, you can easily monitor occupancy levels and make sure that everyone is following the guidelines.
